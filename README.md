-> Frontend is achieved using React. 
-> API Gateway: is the entrypoint of the backend, all requests go throught it. 
  - to access the content, you should be authenticated. This service talks to the authentication service.
  - if a user is logged, then it communicates with the Eureka service to fetch the instance of the patient, note and evaluation services.
  - if not logged, the access is denied.
  - responsible for Load Balancing.
-> Service authentication: responsible to authenticate a user. Implements JWT.
-> Service cloud config: responsible to fetch application-properties from github, stored at https://github.com/AntoineMulpas/microservice-config-repo
-> Service Eureka: register each instance of service, therefore enable service discovery.
-> Service patient: responsible for the patient business, add, update, retrieve and delete from Postgres DB.
-> Service note: responsible for the note business, add, delete and retrieve from MongoDB.
-> Service evaluation: responsible to analyse notes from a patient file and calculate the risks associated.
